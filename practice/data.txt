This code works perfectly. Nothing is wrong with it, except for the fact that Node.js
buffers the entire contents of data.txt before sending the data back to the client. With the increase of clients requests your application could start to consume a lot of memory. In addition clients will need to wait for the entire file to be read by the server application, resulting in increased latency.
