Streams can be defined as a continuous flow of data that can be manipulated asynchronously as data comes in (or out). In Node.js streams can be readable or writable. A readable stream is an EventEmitter object that emits data events every time a chunk of data is received. In our previous example a readable stream has been used to pipe the content of a file down to a HTTP client. When the stream reaches the end of our file it emits an end event, indicating that no more data events will occur. In addition a readable stream can be paused and resumed.
